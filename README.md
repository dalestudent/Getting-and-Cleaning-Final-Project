# Getting-and-Cleaning-Final-Project
This is the final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

There is only one script file for this project, run_analysis.R
The script performs the following tasks:
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Due to size limitations related to the public GitHub account, the source data files /test/X_train.txt and /train/X_test.txt have been zipped up. If you clone or fork this project you should extract those two files prior to running the script.
